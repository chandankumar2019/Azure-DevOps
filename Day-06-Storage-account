           Storage Account
<------------------------------------------------------->
A Storage Account in cloud computing (especially in Azure) is a service that provides a secure, scalable, and highly available way to store data in the cloud.
Key Features of a Storage Account
✅ Scalability – Can handle massive amounts of data efficiently.
✅ Security – Supports encryption, role-based access control (RBAC), and private endpoints.
✅ Durability – Provides replication options like LRS, GRS, ZRS, and RA-GRS to prevent data loss.
✅ Cost-Effective – Different pricing tiers based on usage and redundancy requirements.
✅ Multi-Protocol Support – Works with REST APIs, SDKs, CLI, and PowerShell.

Types of Storage in a Storage Account
<------------------------------------------------------->
1️⃣ Blob Storage – Stores unstructured data like images, videos, and backups.
How many types of Blobs:
They are THree stypes:
1>Block blob:>Ant type of data> Images, video, file, etc(4.7tb store)
2>Append Blob:>Ex:Logs (Logs in nothing but activity)
3>Page Blob:>VHD's(8Tb)
logs>>It is a Activity.
2️⃣ File Storage – Provides fully managed cloud file shares (SMB/NFS).
3️⃣ Queue Storage – Handles messaging between services asynchronously.
4️⃣ Table Storage – NoSQL storage for structured data.
5️⃣ Disk Storage – Used for virtual machine disks.
Managed Disk:>>Azure itself -->>Azure Disk-->>Ex:Pendrive
UnManaged Disk:>>We need to manage-->>Storage Account
<------------------------------------------------------->
Replication Options in Azure Storage Account
<------------------------------------------------------->
🔹 LRS (Locally Redundant Storage) – Keeps three copies of data within a single data center.
what do you mean by redundant simple definition 
Not or no longer needed or useful; unnecessary.
🔹 GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage) – Replicates data across different geographic regions.
🔹 ZRS (Zone-Redundant Storage) – Stores copies across multiple availability zones.
🔹 RA-GRS (Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage) – Same as GRS but allows read access to the
Structured Storage:>>> Stores data in a fixed format, like tables in a database (e.g., SQL, Excel). Easy to search and organize.
Unstructured Storage: >>>Stores data without a predefined format, like images, videos, or documents (e.g., Blob Storage, AWS S3). Flexible but harder to search.
