What is a Logic App?
<------------------------->
A Logic App is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows you to automate workflows and integrate various services without writing extensive code.
Automate Workflows – Eliminate manual processes by automating repetitive tasks.
Integrate Applications & Services – Connect different cloud/on-premises services like SharePoint, SQL Server, Salesforce, Office 365, and third-party APIs.
Before Logic Apps (Traditional Approach)
<----------------------------------------->
Developers had to write custom code to integrate different services.
Used C#, Python, Java, or PowerShell to handle automation.
Without Logic Apps, you would:
<----------------------------------------->
Write a custom script to connect to Outlook API.
Extract and save the attachment using Azure Blob Storage API.
Call Microsoft Teams API to send a notification.
Maintain security/authentication manually.
With Logic Apps (Modern Approach)
<----------------------------------------->
Use pre-built connectors (e.g., Outlook, Blob Storage, Teams).
No need for writing complex backend code.
Provides drag-and-drop UI to design workflows.
Scalable & Cost-effective (pay only for execution).
Example (With Logic Apps)
✅ In Azure Logic Apps, you can create a workflow like:
Trigger: When a new email arrives in Outlook.
Action 1: Extract attachment from the email.
Action 2: Upload it to Azure Blob Storage.
Action 3: Send a message to Microsoft Teams.
