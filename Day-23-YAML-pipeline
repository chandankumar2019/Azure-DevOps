What is YAML Pipeline:
An Azure YAML Pipeline is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline in Azure DevOps defined using YAML syntax. It automates building, testing, and deploying applications.
         TRIGGER:
<------------------------->
The trigger section defines the events or conditions that will trigger the exution of your pipeline.Trigger can be based on specific branch, tags, or even schedules.
       Variable:
<------------------------->
Store values that can be reused throughout the pipeline, such as environment variable, credentials and configuration setting.
       Stages:
<------------------------->
Stages represent the major phases of your CI/CD process. Each stage can contain one or more jobs.
       Jobs:
<------------------------->
Jobs represent the individual units of work within a stage.Each job can consists of one or more steps, defining the tasks to be executed.

create
After that go to repository inside wright side(click three douct-New-File)
Any name(google search Simple YAML File and past)
commit 
commit
Go to pipelines
pipelines
Where is your code?(Azure repository git)
Select a repository(your repository name select)
Configure your pipeline(Existing Azure pipelines YAML pipelines)
Branch(Master)
path(/your pasth is automatic come)
