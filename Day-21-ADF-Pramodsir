How do you integrate ADF pipeline with Azure DevOps & implement CI/CD
in company or industroy how to use in real time give me ans in real time use company 5 to 6 line

In a real-time company setup, integrating Azure Data Factory (ADF) with Azure DevOps enables automated CI/CD for data pipelines. Here's how it's used in industries:

Version Control: ADF JSON pipeline code is stored in Azure Repos (Git) for version control.

CI Process: Developers push changes to a feature branch, triggering Azure DevOps Pipelines for validation.

CD Process: Upon approval, the pipeline automates deployment using ARM Templates into Dev, UAT, and Prod environments.

Automated Testing: Data validation scripts and automated tests ensure pipeline integrity before release.

Monitoring & Rollback: Logs and alerts in Azure Monitor help track failures, and rollback strategies are in place for production stability.

This approach ensures efficient, secure, and automated ADF pipeline deployments across environments in real-world enterprise applications.

If you're asked about your previous job and you want to highlight your experience with ADF, Azure DevOps, and CI/CD, you can structure your answer like this:

ðŸ‘‰ "In my previous role, I worked on integrating Azure Data Factory (ADF) with Azure DevOps to implement CI/CD pipelines for automated data pipeline deployments. I managed version control using Azure Repos, set up build and release pipelines in Azure DevOps, and automated deployments using ARM templates. This ensured smooth data flow across development, testing, and production environments. Additionally, I monitored pipeline executions, optimized performance, and implemented rollback strategies for production stability. My role also involved collaborating with data engineers and cloud teams to enhance automation and efficiency."

This answer clearly explains your responsibilities, technologies used, and how you contributed to the project.
