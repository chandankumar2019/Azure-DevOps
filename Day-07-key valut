     Key Features of a Key Vault
<------------------------------------------------>
main three types are use 
key
secret
certificate

1>>Secret Management – Securely store passwords, API keys, database credentials, etc.
2>>Key Management – Manage cryptographic keys (symmetric & asymmetric) for encryption and decryption.
3>>Certificate Management – Securely store and manage SSL/TLS certificates.
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) / TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over the internet.
4>>Access Control – Uses role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can access the vault.
5>>Logging & Auditing – Tracks access and usage of keys and secrets for security compliance.
Pricing Tier means>>>A Pricing Tier refers to different levels of service offerings, each with varying features, limits, and costs.
Permission model
Azure role-based access control (recommended)
Vault access policy
Both models define how users, applications, and services can access secrets, keys, and certificates within the Key Vault.
Resource access  >>>Resource Access in Azure refers to how different Azure services, applications, and users interact with other Azure resources securely and efficiently.
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) for authentication and deployment.
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) for template-based deployments.
Azure Disk Encryption for encrypting storage volumes.
