                   AZURE
<--------------------------------------------------------->
Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform that provides compute, storage, networking, AI, and DevOps services to build, deploy, and manage applications globally.
BUILD>>>>>A build is the process of compiling and packaging code into a runnable application.
COMPLING>>>>>Compiling is converting source code into machine-readable code
PACKING>>>packaging is bundling the compiled code into a deployable format(ex.jar,war)
JAR>>>A JAR file is a compressed package for Java classes and resources
WAR>>A War file is used to package and deploy web applications.
Deploy>>Deployment is the process of releasing and managing software or infrastructure in a specific environment for users to access and use.
Types of Deployment
Manual Deployment – Manually transferring and configuring the application.
Automated Deployment – Using CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to automate the process.
Rolling Deployment – Gradually replacing old versions with new ones to minimize downtime.
Blue-Green Deployment – Running two environments (Blue & Green) and switching traffic to the new version.
Canary Deployment – Releasing updates to a small subset of users before full deployment.
Jenkins (CI/CD Automation)
Docker (Containerization)
Kubernetes (Orchestration)
Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
AWS, Azure, GCP (Cloud Deployment)
Managing>>It is refers to the process of controlling, organizing, and maintaining resources, systems, or operations to ensure efficiency, stability, and desired outcomes.

           Azure DevOps 
<--------------------------------------------------------->
Azure DevOps is a set of cloud-based tools and services from Microsoft that helps teams manage and automate the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It provides features for source control, CI/CD, infrastructure automation, testing, monitoring, and project management.
Azure Repos – Git repositories for source control.
Azure Pipelines – CI/CD automation for building, testing, and deploying applications.
Azure Artifacts – Package management for storing and sharing dependencies.
Azure Boards – Agile project tracking with Kanban boards and work items.
Azure Test Plans – Testing tools for manual and automated testing.

             Region
<--------------------------------------------------------->
An Azure Region is a geographical area that contains multiple data centers
<--------------------------------------------------------->
     Avability Zones
<--------------------------------------------------------->
Availability Zones are physically separate data centers within an Azure Region.
<--------------------------------------------------------->
         What is Tenant ID
<--------------------------------------------------------->
A Tenant ID in Azure is a unique identifier (GUID) assigned to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. It helps identify and manage an organization’s Azure environment.
<--------------------------------------------------------->
           Subscription
<--------------------------------------------------------->
it is deploy and manage the cloud resources .
<--------------------------------------------------------->
      Resource Group 
<--------------------------------------------------------->
It is a container that holds multiple cloud resources.
<--------------------------------------------------------->
           VNet(virtual Network)
<--------------------------------------------------------->
Azure Virtual Network (VNet) that allows resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks
✔ Subnetting – Divides the VNet into smaller networks for better management.
✔ Peering – Connects multiple VNets for seamless communication.
✔ VPN Gateway – Securely connects on-premises networks to Azure.
✔ Network Security Groups (NSGs) – Controls traffic with security rules.
✔ Azure Bastion – Provides secure RDP/SSH access without public IPs.
<--------------------------------------------------------->
What is a Virtual Machine (VM)
<--------------------------------------------------------->
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based simulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system (OS) and applications just like a physical machine but is hosted on a physical server or cloud environment.
<--------------------------------------------------------->
          Types of Virtual Machines
<--------------------------------------------------------->
1>>.System Virtual Machine – Provides a full OS environment (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS).
2>>.Process Virtual Machine – Runs a single application (e.g., Java Virtual Machine (JVM)).
<--------------------------------------------------------->
         Subnet
<--------------------------------------------------------->
A Subnet in Azure is a smaller network inside a Virtual Network (VNet) that helps organize and manage resources efficiently by dividing the IP address space. 
<--------------------------------------------------------->
            Ip Address
<--------------------------------------------------------->
An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to a device on a network to identify and enable communication over the internet or a private network. 
<--------------------------------------------------------->
              CIDR
<--------------------------------------------------------->
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a method for efficiently allocating IP addresses by using a slash (/) notation to define the network portion of an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24). It helps in subnetting and reducing IP wastage.
